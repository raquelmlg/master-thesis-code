Mathematical Modeling, Analysis and Simulations of Bacterial Microcolony Growth

## Overview
This repository contains the code and data associated with my thesis titled "Mathematical Modeling, Analysis and Simulations of Bacterial Microcolony Growth".
Abstract: 
This thesis explores the mathematical modeling, analysis and simulations of bacterial microcolony growth, with a focus on developing easy to understand models for bacterial growth that align
closely with reality. Building upon the model presented by Kuttler and Maslovskaya (2022), it provides an improved framework for modeling bacterial colony growth, with the innovation of accounting for factors 
like nutrient availability and space constraints. It includes a thorough analysis and comparison of models with different levels of realism and efficiency.
Furthermore, it incorporates the effects of antibiotics in reducing bacterial density, and a generalized model that includes multiple antibiotic application and bacterial regrowth. 
For every developed model, simulations of bacterial growth and an analysis of their results are presented.

The models presented are implemented using the language Python. The implementations can have numerous applications, from the study of bacterial dynamics and behaviour, 
to the analysis of the effect of certain antibiotics, or can even serve as a base for the study of more complex processes such as bacterial communication (Kuttler and Maslovskaya (2021)).
